## USGS `dataRetrieval` R package to retrieve hydrological data

USGS is managing a vast [network of gauges](https://dashboard.waterdata.usgs.gov/app/nwd/?region=lower48&aoi=default) to monitor freshwater across the US.


### Exercise 1

- Create a new repository on GitHub named `api-practice` (add the README.md)
- Clone it using RStudio server on Taylor (hint: new project)
- Start a new Quarto document:
    - Using `dataRetrieval` get the the discharge (ftÂ³/s) time-series for the Ventura River (site `11118500`) during the recent Hilary tropical storm from 2023-08-19 to 2023-08-22
    - Plot the time-series usgin `ggplot2`
    - What was the maximum discharge during this period of time?

Webpage: <https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv?site_no=11118500>

Tutorial for the package can be found here: 
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html#daily-data>


### Bonus

- How would you try to determine when this stream gauge record started (read the documentation :) ) ?
- How does the max value compare to the discharge during the storm on 2023-01-09 ?



## `metajam`

The `metajam` R package relies on the dataONE API to download data **and** metadata into your R Environment. It is currently supporting KNB, ADC and EDI repositories because they rely on the metadata standard EML.

Short [intro](https://brunj7.github.io/EDS-214-analytical-workflows/slides/metajam_intro.html) to the package


### Exercise 2

Let's determine what percentage of Alaskan household are speaking only English!

The data: https://doi.org/10.5063/F1N58JPP

1. Read the metadata on the website
4. Start a new R script and write a code to:
    - download the data `household_language.csv` using `metajam`
    - Read the data into R using `metajam`
    - compute the percentage of Alaskan household speaking only English from 2009 to 2015
5. Create a plot to visualize this data


### Bonus

- How does it compare to French?
